## My Introduction to Bootstrap

### Part 1
In the first part we were shown how to focus on building the structure on the web page using **HTML** and **Bootstrap** classes. 
At this point it is very obvious that the page has been constructed using **Bootstrap** elements.

### Part 2
We then added CSS styling to further enhance the page styling, customising elements to enhance the asthetics of the page. 

At times overriding the **Bootstrap** elements was a little challenging, however with help from my friend Google I found 
there hardly a question that has never been asked, and answered.
